# Loan-Calulator
Fundemantal of JS and DOM

An small application that an actual accountant could use to quickly show their clients how long it would 
take to pay a loan back, how much interest would be, how much the total amount would be, and so on.

In this app I had to look up the calculations and the formula to get these results.

I used CDN bootstrap in this application.
